# to-do-list
This is a basic command-line To-Do List Manager written in Python. It allows users to:

*View tasks

*Add tasks

*Remove tasks

*Save tasks to a text file (tasks.txt)

It uses Python lists for in-memory task handling and the built-in open() function for file operations â€” no external libraries required.
